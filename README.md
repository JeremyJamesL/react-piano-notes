# In browser piano note training

Took up the piano recently, just a simple way for me to practice piano notes in the browser.

[Play here](https://piano.jezl.xyz)

Using:

- React App
- SASS (custom piano render, no helpers!)

## To do:

- Support for sharps and flats
- Responsive (render smaller piano and reduce # of keys to guess) for smaller devices
- Expand support for all 88 keys (currently a smaller subset)
- Fix misclick on flats and sharps
- Utilise vexflow
